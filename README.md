# Top Domains
Top domains list generated by [Webshrinker](https://webshrinker.com/) and [DNSFilter](https://dnsfilter.com/).


# Methodology
DNSFilter extracts this list of top domains from DNS traffic seen by customers. In order to avoid exposing any potentially sensitive domains, we drop any queries for domains that less than 20 distinct organizations have looked up.

Any domain that was looked up by more than 20 organizations receives 1 vote per organization per day. The ranking is then determined by the total number of votes for each domain over the entire month.
