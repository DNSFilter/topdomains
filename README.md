# DNSFilter Top Domains
This is the DNSFilter Top Domains List, generated by [Webshrinker](https://webshrinker.com/) and [DNSFilter](https://dnsfilter.com/). This is a list of domains seen, ranked by number of queries and filtered, generated monthly.

DNSFilter is a protective DNS service that classifies domains and allows customers to configure policies to block different categories. The source dataset (the DNS queries seen by DNSFilter) is around 50bn queries per day as of Feb 2023, although this is growing.

# Methodology
DNSFilter extracts this list of top domains from DNS queries seen from customers. In order to avoid exposing any potentially sensitive domains, we drop any queries for domains that less than 20 distinct organizations have looked up.

Any domain that was looked up by more than 20 organizations receives 1 vote per organization per day. The ranking is then determined by the total number of votes for each domain over the entire month.
