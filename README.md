# Top Domains
Top domains list generated by [Webshrinker](https://webshrinker.com/) and [DNSFilter](https://dnsfilter.com/).


# Methodology
DNSFilter extracts this list of top domains from DNS traffic seen by customers. In order to avoid exposing any potentially sensitive domains, we drop any queries for domains that less than 20 distinct organizations looked up.

Each organizations then gets 1 "vote" per domain per day, we generate the list of top domains based on number of votes per month.
